<h2>Download</h2>

<p>
The source code for both HILTI and BinPAC++ is hosted at
<tt>git://git.icir.org/hilti</tt>. There's is also
<a href="http://www.github.com/rsmmr/hilti">a mirror on github</a>.
We do not offer any prepackaged source or binary downloads for the
time being.
</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>
There is the
<a href="{{ pathto("manual")}}">start of a manual</a>. It's very
preliminary at this point, and very incomplete.
</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<dl>

<dt>What's the current implementation status?</dt>
<dd>
HILTI and BinPAC++ are currently in prototype state; they aren't
production-ready yet. While they are functional and provide most of
the initially target functionality at this point, that doesn't mean
they are necessarily also stable, robust, efficient, portable,
user-friendly, or documented.
</dd>

<dt>Well, so when do you expect this all to be production-ready then?</dt>
<dd>
There's quite a bit still left to do, and it will require more
resources to make that happen. <a href="#contact">Let us know</a>
if you want to help.
</dd>

<dt>Which platforms are supported?</dt>
<dd>
We develop HILTI and BinPAC++ on 64-bit Linux and MacOS; other
platforms are unlikely to work at the moment.
</dd>

<dt>Can I use BinPAC++ with Bro?</dt>
<dd>
Yes, we have developed a
<a href="{{ pathto("binpac/bro/index")}}">Bro plugin</a>
that integrages BinPAC++ transparently into
<a href="http://www.bro.org">Bro</a>.
</dd>

<dt>Oh, so is this all tied to Bro?</dt>
<dd>
No, not at all. While coming out of the
<a href="http://www.bro.org">Bro Project</a>,
HILTI and BinPAC++ are standalone systems designed with generic C APIs
suitable for integration into a wide range of potentially quite
different applications.
</dd>

<dt>Sounds all great, what's the license?</dt>
<dd>
HILTI and BinPAC++ are open-source and come with a BSD license, which
allows for pretty much unrestricted use as long as you leave the
license header in place.
</dd>

<dt>Who's behind all this?</dt>
<dd>
HILTI and BinPAC++ are being develop by the 
<a href="http://www.icir.org">Networking and Security
Group</a> at the <a href="http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu">International
Computer Science Institute</a>, a non-profit research institute
affiliated with the <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu">University of
California, Berkeley</a>. Development is being funded by the
<a href="http://www.nsf.gov">National Science Foundation</a>.

<h2>About HILTI</h2>

<p>
When developing networking systems such as firewalls, routers, and
intrusion detection systems, one faces a striking gap between the ease
with which one can often describe a desired analysis in high-level
terms, and the tremendous amount of low-level implementation details
that one must still grapple with to come to a robust solution. HILTI
bridges this divide by providing an abstract execution environment for
deep, stateful network traffic analysis. It offers <em>platform</em>
to application developers that provides much of the low-level
functionality, without tying it to a specific analysis structure.
</p>

<p>
HILTI consists of two parts: (1) an <em>abstract machine mode</em> that
caters specifically to the networking domain, directly supporting the
field's common abstractions and idioms in its instruction set; and (2)
a <em>compiler toolchain</em>, built on top of <a
href="http://www.llvm.org">LLVM</a>, for turning programs
written for the abstract machine into optimized, natively executable
code.
</p>

<h2>About BinPAC++</h2>

<p>
BinPAC++ is a next-generation parser generator that makes it easy to
build parsers for network protocols, file formats, and more. BinPAC++
is more than just a "yacc for protocols": it's an all-in-one system
that enables developers to write attributed grammars defining both
syntax and semantics of an input format inside a single comprehensive
scripting langauage.
</p>

<p>
The BinPAC++ toolchain, built on top of HILTI, turns such grammars
into efficient parsing code that exposes an well-defined C interface
to its host application for feeding in input and retrieving results.
At runtime, parsing proceeds fully incrementally&mdash;and potentially
in parallel&mdash;on input streams of arbitrary size. Compilation
takes place either statically at build time, or or just-in-time at
startup.
