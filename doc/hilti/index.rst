HILTI: A High-Level Intermediary Language for Traffic Inspection
================================================================

Version |release|, |today|

.. note::

    Much of HILTI's functionality has not yet been ported from the
    older Python prototype to the new compiler infrastructure. It's to
    prudent to assume that everything without a succeeding test is not
    yet functioning.
