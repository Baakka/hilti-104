# This test checks that with a large HTTP message, the input is parsed
# in small chunks without buffering them unnecessarily. In other words,
# even though the input is large, the heap size should stay 
# constant as memory management cleans up.
#
# If this fails, then somewhere a on the upper layers of the call stack
# a pointer is referencing already processed input, preventing
# reference counting from cleaning up. If the latter, it can be hard to pinpoint
# unfortunately where exactly that's happening.
