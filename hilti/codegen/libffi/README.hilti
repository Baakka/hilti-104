This is cloned from https://github.com/LuaDist/libffi.

The only reason to use that instead of the master repository is that
the Lua version has been CMakefied.

It may potentially be modified to interface our code generator to some
of the low-level code.

The CMakeLists.txt has also been tweaked a bit further.

Note that we don't actually use libffi at runtime. We only include it
to leverage some of the its ABI knowledge to generate ABI-conforming
function signatures and calls.
