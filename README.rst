HILTI and Spicy
===============

HILTI provides an abstract machine model that caters specifically to
the networking domain, directly supporting the field's common
abstractions and idioms in its instruction set. It comes with compiler
toolchain, built on top of LLVM, that turns HILTI programs into
optimized, natively executable code just in time.

Spicy is a next-generation parser generator, built on top of HILTI,
that makes it easy to build parsers for network protocols, file
formats, and more. Spicy is more than just a "yacc for protocols":
it's an all-in-one system that enables developers to write attributed
grammars defining both syntax and semantics of an input format inside
a single comprehensive scripting langauage.
