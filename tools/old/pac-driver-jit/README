pac-driver is a standalone driver for BinPAC++ parsers. It compiles
parsers just-in-time and then feeds them its standard input.

Note that most of the code here is a clone of the original pac-driver,
with JIT functionality added. Eventually we should either remove one
of the two, or merge the two (if that makes sense), or factor out the
common functionality if we want to keep both.
