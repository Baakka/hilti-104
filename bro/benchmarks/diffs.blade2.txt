- http-compiler-logs:

    * http.log:

        - For two connections, the compiled version doesn't record
          their MIME type. However, when extracting the corresponding
          connections from the trace and running just on those, the
          MIME type *is* logged correctly. Not sure what that is, but
          seems neglible.

    * files.log:

        - The two missing MIME types from above show up here too.

        - The various byte counters and last_seens fields aren't set
          right because that's something the core updates in the
          background. Ignoring.

        - One additional entry shows up. Not sure why.

        - The "source" UID lists are recorded in different order;
          that's expected.

- dns-compiler-logs:

    * dns.log:

         - Tiny nit: One response address gets logged a IPv6 in Bro
           but IPv4 in HILTI. But it's same address (0.0.0.1 vs ::::1)

        (- [FIXED] The compiled version is logging some more DNS
                   entries. It seems that's actually correct and they
                   are missing in the original log file. Upon closer
                   inspection, Bro's DNS logs seems non-deterministc
                   in some cases (even after merging in the
                   soon-to-be-2.3 DNS script). See ticket BIT-1153.)

- dns-spicy-logs:

    * dns.log:

        - Spicy logs some unmatched queries more than once because
          it doesn't install an dns_timeout timer; which in turn skips
          some connection_state_remove events that would otherwise
          flush the state so that it doesn't get logged again.

          Potential fix: let Spicy analyzer install a similar
          timer. But doesn't seem crucial.

        - A small number of requests are marked as rejected by the
          standard anayzers, but not by Spicy. These are actually NTP
          sessions that seem to trigger a difference somewhere.
          Doesn't matter. (This is traffic between UDP ports 53 and
          123. Confirmed NTP in tshark).

        - Spicy logs things like "qclass-1479" and "query-50217"
          when it doesn't recognize something, legacy doesn't.

        - Tiny nit: One response address gets logged a IPv6 in Bro but
          IPv4 with Spicy. But it's same address (0.0.0.1 vs ::::1)

        - Bro's DNS analyzer extracts only the first CharacterString
          out of a TXT record; Spicy all.

- http-spicy-logs:

    Changes to http/main.bro:
        - Use script-level URI deciding function.

    * http.log

        Normalizations TODO:
            - Equalize "<empty>" and "(empty")"

    * TODO: Diffs to checout
          - request_body_len/response_body_len empty
          - URL decryption

Script changes:
===============

    dns/main.bro:

    * Pulled in 2.3 version as the 2.2 version yields
      non-deterministic output.

    * Changed a "vector of Info" to "vector of Any"; then had to
      disable the dns_unmatched_msg weirds.
