Log diffs with /da/robin/data/trace.blade15.port80.c.30g
========================================================

- dns-spicy-logs:

    * dns.log: (All insignificant, by far the most match completely).

        - Legacy analyzer splits queries with SERVFAIL response into
          two entries, Spicy keeps them together. Not sure why.

        - Spicy logs things like "qclass-1479" and "query-50217"
          when it doesn't recognize something, legacy doesn't.

        - A response address can get logged as IPv6 in Bro but
          IPv4 with Spicy. But it's same address (0.0.0.1 vs ::::1)

        - Bro's DNS analyzer extracts only the first CharacterString
          out of a TXT record; Spicy all.

        - Some sessions that aren't actually DNS get parsed by the two
          analyzers to different degrees. Seems the legacy one aborts
          more easily.

- dns-compiler-log:

    * dns.log
        - A response address can get logged as IPv6 in Bro but
          IPv4 with Spicy. But it's same address (0.0.0.1 vs ::::1)

- http-compiler-log:

    * http.log:

        - Proxy headers can get recorded in a different order because of
          set ordering.

        - For one case, we get a MIME type wrong:
          application/octet-stream rather than msword.

    * files.log:

        - The "source" UIDs can get recorded in a different order
           because of set ordering.

        - We get one application/x-dosexec entry more, not sure why.

        - seen_bytes and missing_bytes aren't right because we don't
          extract that information and/or the core updates that in the
          background. Ignoring by removing before comparision.

        - duration isn't set because the core updates that in the
          background.  Ignoring by removing before comparision.

Script changes:
===============

    Compared to 2982abe752 (last merge with origin/master)

    base/protocols/dns/main.bro:

    * Pulled in 2.3 version as the 2.2 version yields
      non-deterministic output.

    * Changed a "vector of Info" to "vector of Any"; then had to
      disable the dns_unmatched_msg weirds.

    base/files/hash/main.bro

    * Rewrote code to not use "switch" because compiler does not yet
      support that.

    base/frameworks/logging/main.bro

    * Added option to disable logging.

    base/init-bare.bro

    * Set udp_inactivity_timeout to 9secs to mimic DNS session
      timeout, which we have disabled. This compensates for the DNS
      Spicy analyzer how having that session timeout.

    base/protocols/dns/http.*

    * Moved get_file_handle() into main.bro to have access to some
      record fields.

    * Track trans_depth separately for originator and responder, and
      use for generating file handle.

    * Use unescape_URI() for unescaping URIs, not the event's parameter.

    base/utils/queue.bro:

    * Do a manual deep copy to avoid using copy().

Source changes:
==============

 - Added profiler.

 - Plugin interface.

 - DNS: Disable expire timer when dns_session_timeout is zero.

 - HTTP: Disabled the potential recovery from content gaps with
   bodies. The Spicy analyzer doesn't support that yet, so it would be
   unfaor to have standard Bro keep crunching (these conns can be
   huge, see http.e.trace).
