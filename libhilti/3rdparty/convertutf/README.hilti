Changes from the original version:

- We changed the type names from UTF8, UTF16 to UTF8_t, UTF16_t, etc.

- We changed the definitions for UTF8, UTF16 to uintX_t

- the return type of isLegalUTF8Sequence changed to uint8_t and we 
  removed the definition of Boolean

- introduce flip-parameter in ConvertUTF16toUTF8 and ConvertUTF32toUTF8
  that tells the function to flip the byte-order
