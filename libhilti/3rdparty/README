HILTI's run-time library leverages the following 3rd party libraries:

    - libpqueue:  https://github.com/vy/libpqueue
    - libtask:    http://swtch.com/libtask
    - khash:      http://www.freewebs.com/attractivechaos
    - convertUTF: http://www.unicode.org

Note that we sometimes adapt the source somewhat, and/or we may use
only a subset of the functionality they provide. See README.hilti in
the corresponding directories.
