For HILTI, we adapated libpqueue a bit:

- pqueue_pri_t is defined as hlt_time.

- The comparision/accessor functions are hard-coded as inline function to work
  directly with the libhilti/timer.h data structures. 

- We use the HILTI memory management functions.

- The output functionality is removed.
