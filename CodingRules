Passing pointers into functions:

    - Use real pointers ("*") only if the function doesn't store the
      pointer beyond its return; or internally in private methods if
      you know what you are doing.

    - Use unique_ptr if the function takes ownership.

    - Use shared_ptr otherwise (probably the most common case).

* Pass references only as const.
